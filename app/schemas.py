"""OpenAI-compatible request and response shapes.

This file is GIVEN, complete. The contract's teeth are not the exercise: your
job is to fill in the routes in main.py so they read these requests and return
these responses. Do not weaken these models. The Agentic AI cohort's client
(and the openai Python client) expects exactly these field names.

The `tools`/`tool_choice` fields are accepted from day 1 (the contract says a
consumer's payload always validates) and go unused until the tool-calling
engine at tier 1.
